# Class 5 Demo Suite

These demos follow the Class 5 story: a Streamlit user interface, a FastAPI backend, and optional Langfuse monitoring. The code uses only beginner-friendly Python so that students can read and tweak it easily.

| Demo | Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Streamlit Chat UI | `streamlit-chat-ui/` | Minimal chat interface that calls the FastAPI `/chat` endpoint and shows where responses come from. |
| FastAPI Agent Service | `fastapi-agent-service/` | Chat API that wraps a LangGraph ReAct agent (two tools) with a rule-based fallback and Langfuse traces when keys are provided. |

## Before you start

- Install Python 3.10 or newer.
- Make sure you can open a terminal (macOS/Linux Terminal, Windows PowerShell).
- Every demo includes a `requirements.txt` file listing the packages you need.
- Run the backend first, then launch the Streamlit UI so the chat button has somewhere to send requests.

Open each demoâ€™s README and follow the numbered checklist. Every step shows the exact command to copy so you can reproduce the class walkthrough on your own laptop.

> **Tip:** Leave the API keys blank during class practice and the demos will still run using the built-in helper replies.
